            <h1>Mortgage</h1>
            <p>Bankmortgage calculator gives you a monthly payment estimate after you input the home price, your down payment, the interest rate and length of the loan term. Use the calculator to price different scenarios. You might discover you need to adjust your down payment to keep your monthly payments affordable. You can also see the loan amortization schedule, or how your debt is reduced over time with monthly principal and interest payments. If you want to pay off a mortgage before the loan term is over,
             you can use the calculator to figure out how much more you must pay each month to achieve your goal.
                Other mortgage calculators can answer a variety of questions: What is your DTI, or debt-to-income ratio? That’s a percentage that lenders look at to gauge your debt load. Should you take out a 15-year mortgage or a 30-year? Fixed interest rate or variable?
             It’s critical to nail down the numbers before buying a home because a mortgage is a secured loan that is secured by the home itself. If you fail to make the monthly payments, the lender can foreclose and take your home.
