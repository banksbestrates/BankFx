"SSH SFTP Updater Support" is the easiest way to keep your Wordpress installation up-to-date with SFTP.

== Description ==

Keeping your Wordpress install up-to-date and installing plugins in a hassle-free manner is not so easy if your server uses SFTP. "SSH SFTP Updater Support" for WordPress uses phpseclib to remedy this deficiency.

To use it, after installing and activating the plugins, add the necessary constants early in the code in your wp-config.php:

a) `define('FS_METHOD', 'ssh2');`

b) Others as <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php#WordPress_Upgrade_Constants">detailed in the official WP codex</a>
